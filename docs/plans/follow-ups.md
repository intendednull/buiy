# Layout follow-ups

**Date:** 2026-05-21
**Status:** active

Tracked-but-not-yet-scheduled work surfaced by completed layout phases. Each
entry names the originating phase, the divergence from spec / open behavior,
and a sketch of the implementation direction. When a follow-up gets
chartered into its own phase or plan, move the entry to that plan and link
back here.

## Descendant invalidation on ancestor-resolved-size changes

**Originated:** Phase 5 (container queries), Task 10 implementer finding +
reviewer mandate. Plan `docs/plans/2026-05-21-buiy-layout-container-queries.md`
v3 revision documents the gap.

**Symptom:** when an ancestor `A`'s `ResolvedLayout` changes (e.g., a
parent container is resized) and a `Cqw`-sized intermediate `B` sits
between `A` and a rule-bearing descendant `C`, the intermediate is not
re-translated and the descendant's `ContainerQuery` never re-evaluates.
`B`'s Taffy width stays at the previously-baked `Cqw` resolution.

**Cause:** `sync_styles`'s `Or<(Changed<T>, ...)>` trigger filter is
per-entity. Bevy provides no "ancestor's `T` changed" filter primitive.
When `A.ResolvedLayout` changes, `A`'s own `Changed<ResolvedLayout>` bit
fires (and Phase 5 added that to the filter so initial-frame cascades
work), but `B` and `C` see no `Changed<*>` bits because their own
components are unchanged. They are skipped by `sync_styles` and
therefore by Buiy's container-unit resolution.

**Why Phase 5 didn't fix it:** the fix requires either (a) a separate
descendant-invalidation pass that walks down the hierarchy from each
container with a freshly-changed `ResolvedLayout` and force-ticks
sync_styles' filter on descendants, or (b) a fundamentally different
filter primitive (e.g., a `DescendantOf<Changed<T>>` query filter Bevy
doesn't ship). Either path expands Phase 5's chartered scope. Phase 5
ships the direct-ancestor cascade (handled by `cq_flip_check` reading
`tree.layout()` + `cq_flip_rerun`) and documents the multi-level gap.

**Current test that documents the gap:**
`crates/buiy_core/tests/layout_container_queries.rs::cq_transitive_cascade_is_one_frame_stale`
— a *negative assertion* asserting C stays Inactive after A's resize.
When this follow-up lands, the assertion polarity flips to positive
(C becomes Active in-frame).

**Implementation sketch (for the future phase):**
1. After `write_resolved_layout` (step 7) computes which entities'
   `ResolvedLayout` changed this frame, identify the subset that are
   query containers (have `Container { container_type != Normal }`).
2. For each such container, walk its descendants and mark them for
   re-translation. Mechanism options:
   - Insert/touch a private `ContainerSizeDirty` marker component that
     `sync_styles`' Or-filter picks up.
   - Or: build a `HashSet<Entity>` of "dirty descendants" resource that
     `sync_styles` checks alongside `Changed<>`.
3. Trigger a same-frame re-run analogous to `cq_flip_rerun` so the
   descendants re-resolve their `Cqw` against the new ancestor sizes
   within the same frame.

**Cost:** the descendant walk is O(N) per resized container per frame.
In a worst-case theme switch this is O(tree size), but the same
worst-case already exists for Phase 4 writing-mode propagation.

**Spec touchpoint:** `docs/specs/2026-05-08-buiy-layout-design/container-queries-and-writing-modes.md`
§ 1.3 and § 1.5. Spec § 1.3 step 4-5 implies geometric cascade should
catch up in-frame for the *direct* ancestor case (Phase 5 does this).
The multi-level case isn't explicitly addressed by the spec; this
follow-up makes Phase 5's behavior match the most natural reading of
§ 1.5's "fixture A→B→C ... assert frame N applies A's activation,
frame N+1 applies B's" — currently the assertion would never fire
because B never updates.
